# LangChain Framework Study Materials

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with materials about the LangChain framework. All content was sourced from the official LangChain documentation, and the link to each article in the documentation is included in the title of each notebook.

Additionally, there is a notes file named `langchain.txt`, which is not based on the official documentation. Instead, it was created based on a video by an expert (the link to the video is provided at the beginning of the notes file).

## Repository Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic from the LangChain documentation. The title of each notebook includes a link to the relevant article for reference.
- **`langchain.txt`**: A text file containing notes derived from an expert's video.

## Resources

- [LangChain Official Documentation (Tutorials)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)
- Expert video link: Refer to the beginning of the `langchain.txt` file.

Feel free to explore the materials and use them as a reference for learning the LangChain framework.
